# Overview of Installation

Welcome to Amahi!

We realize that installing is the hardest part of getting your Amahi server running. We tried to make easy, however, we realize we need to improve it over time.

The latest stable release of Amahi is for **Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS** (Long Term Support), both desktop or server (headless).
