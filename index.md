# Overview of Installation

Welcome to Amahi!

We realize that installing is the hardest part of getting your Amahi server running. We tried to make easy, however, we realize we need to improve it over time.

The latest stable release of Amahi is the **Amahi 7 Express Disc**, only for 64 bit x86 for now.
