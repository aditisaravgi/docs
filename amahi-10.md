title: Install Amahi 10
---

Welcome to to the **Amahi 10** release!

There are some ways to get Amahi 10 up and running. The best and recommended way is installing from scratch.

However, we also list some alternative options below.

# Installing from Scratch

Installing Amahi fresh is the recommended way to install. It requires the installation of Fedora 25 first. Then Amahi proper. After that is done, you should transition your network devices to using Amahi!

Only 64-bit systems are supported. We do not plan to support 32-bit systems.

Follow the [directions to install Amahi 10](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Amahi_10_Install).

# Upgrading to Amahi 10

Upgrading from an existing 64-bit (_not_ 32-bit) Amahi 9-running system is supported **to a limited extent**.

We have tested this installation path with a fair bit of success, with clean versions and fully-updated versions of Amahi 9. If your system is somewhat modified, it **may not upgrade well**. We cannot possibly support all system hardware/sw configurations.

We **strongly** recommend uninstalling all apps (or as many apps as possible) and reinstalling them after the upgrade.

Visit the [Amahi 9 to Amahi 10](https://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Amahi_10_Upgrade) install guide.

Upgrading from Amahi 8 is not supported, though it may work, if you try it via the OS. Upgrading from earlier releases is not supported. We recommend a fresh install.
